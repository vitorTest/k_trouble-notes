Sample with sublime-text.

Being able to call Sublime Text from the Terminal by just typing sublime

# sudo ln -s /opt/sublime_text_3/sublime_text /usr/bin/sublime

Creating a launcher

# sudo sublime /usr/share/applications/sublime.desktop

Actually, there's a 'sublime_text.desktop', inside the sublime folder...
I'll do not copy the content... Just past it in the 'sublime.desktop'
created above.
